# Troubleshooting

Start with `npm run doctor -- --app-url <url>`: it is read-only, and every failure it
finds prints the command that fixes it. The cases below are the ones it cannot fix
for you.

## The R2 step says the bucket name already exists

R2 bucket names are unique across all Cloudflare accounts, so `cogsend-media`
is only a starting point. Set `bucket_name` in `wrangler.personal.jsonc` (or pass
`--bucket my-cogsend-media` to `setup`) and deploy again. R2 also refuses to create anything until the account has a payment
method on file, even for free-tier usage.

## The deploy complains about cron triggers (10072)

```
✘ [ERROR] Trigger configuration for "…" was only partially updated:
    - This account has reached the Workers Free limit of 5 cron triggers per account … [code: 10072]
Failed: error occurred while running deploy command
```

The Worker and its assets were uploaded — only the schedule was refused. This is
an **account** limit, not a per-Worker one: five cron triggers in total on the
free plan, across every Worker you run, and a fresh project cannot get a sixth
slot.

`npm run deploy` handles this for you: it retries once with the trigger removed
(`"crons": []`) and exits 0, printing the same explanation, so the build is not
marked failed and the app is live. Publishing now works; only scheduled posts
need a tick. Set `COGSEND_STRICT_CRON=1` to get the plain failure instead.

Pick one of these:

1. **Free a slot.** Cloudflare → **Workers & Pages** → the _other_ Worker →
   **Settings → Trigger events → Cron triggers** → delete a schedule you no
   longer need.
2. **Upgrade** the account to Workers Paid (hundreds of triggers).
3. **Use an external cron** and leave the Worker without a trigger. Settings →
   **Scheduled publishing** shows the tick URL and can generate a token; paste
   both into any cron service:

   ```sh
   curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/internal/tick \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <tick token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

   cron-job.org runs a job once a minute on its free plan, UptimeRobot's free
   plan every five minutes, and the repository ships a GitHub Actions workflow
   (`.github/workflows/scheduler-tick.yml`) that needs repository secrets
   `APP_URL` and `SCHEDULER_SECRET`. Ticks are idempotent, so a duplicated or
   delayed caller is harmless. To go trigger-less by choice, delete the
   `triggers` block from your config (or set `"crons": []`).

   Using the env secret instead of the generated token works too: set
   `SCHEDULER_SECRET` and keep the Worker secret and the caller in sync.

`npm run doctor -- --app-url https://your-worker.workers.dev` reports which of
these you are in: ticks arriving, no trigger configured, or a refused trigger.

## The app answers 503: "must not be an example value"

The deployment is running on the example secrets from `.dev.vars.example`. Set a
real one — `openssl rand -hex 32` generates a key — and redeploy:

```sh
node scripts/wrangler.mjs secret put APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY
npm run deploy
```

`npm run doctor -- --app-url <url>` reports this case directly.

## Scheduled posts never fire

Open **Settings → Scheduled publishing** in the app: it says whether a tick has
ever arrived, why one is missing when the last deploy could not attach the
trigger, and offers both a token and a "Tick now" button.

Behind it: the tick runs every minute from the cron trigger in `wrangler.jsonc`
(Cloudflare → **Settings → Trigger events**), or from an external cron calling
`POST /api/internal/tick` with a bearer credential. The built-in cron derives
its own credential from `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; external callers use the token
from that Settings card, or the env `SCHEDULER_SECRET` / `API_TOKEN`. A read-only
check reports the scheduler line:

```sh
npm run doctor -- --app-url <url>
```

## Missing migrations

After pulling new code:

```sh
npm run db:migrate:remote
npm run deploy
```

or `npm run deploy:release`, which runs tests, migrations, build and deploy in
one go.

## Two instances in one Cloudflare account

Give the second instance its own names, or it will adopt the first one's
resources: D1 provisioning matches on `database_name`, and R2 bucket names are
global. `npm run setup -- --name my-cogsend --db my-cogsend --bucket my-cogsend-media`
writes them into `wrangler.personal.jsonc` (gitignored) — the Worker name, the
database's name _and_ its id, and the bucket — so the deploy output, `wrangler
d1 …` and `npm run doctor` all name the instance you think they do.

**Settings → Instance**.
