# API

The browser UI uses the `cog_session` cookie after TOTP. Scripts, Shortcuts,
cron jobs, and MCP clients use a personal API key instead. Create and manage the
key in **Settings → API access**. Choose **Read-only** or **Read + write** when
generating or replacing a key; **Read + write** is the default, and write access
also grants read access.

CogSend keeps one active personal API key. The raw key is displayed once; only
its hash is stored. Generating a replacement immediately revokes the previous
key. Revoke or replace keys in Settings; MCP tools cannot manage keys.

## REST API authentication

Export your instance URL and load the personal key into your shell from a
secret manager or another private source:

```sh
export APP_URL=https://cogsend.<account>.workers.dev
: "${COGSEND_API_KEY:?Load it from a secret manager}"

curl -s "$APP_URL/api/connections" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY"
```

Protected REST API routes accept the standard `Authorization: Bearer` header
or `X-API-Key`. The legacy `API_TOKEN` Worker secret remains supported by those
routes for backwards compatibility. Never put credentials in a URL query
string. These REST authentication alternatives do **not** apply to `/api/mcp`;
see below.

## MCP server

CogSend exposes a curated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server at
`<instance-origin>/api/mcp`. Tool results include text summaries and structured
JSON data. It uses **stateless Streamable HTTP**: clients send MCP requests over
HTTP POST, receive JSON responses, and do not need a session.
GET and DELETE return 405. CogSend does not provide resumable or server-sent
SSE, browser CORS, or OAuth login for this endpoint.

Authenticate every MCP request with an active CogSend personal key in the
standard header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY
```

MCP does not accept session cookies, `X-API-Key`, the legacy `API_TOKEN`,
scheduler credentials, or query-string credentials. A personal key is still
required if Cloudflare Access also protects the instance.

### Key permissions and tool scopes

The permission selected in **Settings → API access** controls the MCP tools as
well as the REST API. A **Read-only** key can call only the tools marked `read`.
A **Read + write** key can call both `read` and `write` tools (`write` includes
`read`). The mapping is enforced by the server on every tool call.

| Tool                   | Required key scope |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| `list_connections`     | `read`             |
| `list_drafts`          | `read`             |
| `get_draft`            | `read`             |
| `validate_post`        | `read`             |
| `list_queue`           | `read`             |
| `create_draft`         | `write`            |
| `update_draft`         | `write`            |
| `duplicate_draft`      | `write`            |
| `delete_draft`         | `write`            |
| `set_draft_variant`    | `write`            |
| `delete_draft_variant` | `write`            |
| `publish_draft`        | `write`            |
| `schedule_draft`       | `write`            |
| `cancel_delivery`      | `write`            |
| `retry_delivery`       | `write`            |
| `reschedule_delivery`  | `write`            |

`list_drafts` and `list_queue` accept an optional `limit` from 1 to 100
(default 50). `list_connections` is unpaginated. The MCP catalog is not a mirror of every REST
route: it does not expose media operations, settings, insights, account or
provider management, API-key management, scheduler administration, the internal
publish endpoint, arbitrary HTTP requests, prompts, resources, or sampling.

### Approval and external effects

Use an MCP client that asks the operator to approve destructive and
open-world actions before execution. The tools annotated as destructive are
`update_draft`, `set_draft_variant`, `delete_draft`, `delete_draft_variant`,
`publish_draft`, `schedule_draft`, `cancel_delivery`, `retry_delivery`, and
`reschedule_delivery`. `publish_draft` and `retry_delivery` are also annotated
as open-world. Before approving publish, retry, schedule, or reschedule, verify
the content, destination, and timing; publish and retry can send content to an
external social network, while schedule and reschedule determine future posts.
The server marks tool risk with MCP annotations, but annotations are hints:
they do not enforce consent. CogSend v1 has no server-side preview/commit confirmation flow, so do
not assume the server will pause for approval if the client does not.

The current MCP SDK/protocol revision used by CogSend does not implement `ping`.
A client that sends `ping` may receive JSON-RPC `-32601` (method not found) with
HTTP 404. Do not use MCP `ping` as a health check.

### Try it with the official MCP Inspector

1. In **Settings → API access**, generate a personal key with the permissions
   you need. Copy it when it is displayed; CogSend will not show it again.
2. Start the official Inspector with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`.
3. In the Inspector, choose **Streamable HTTP**, enter
   `<instance-origin>/api/mcp`, and configure the request header
   `Authorization` using your CogSend key. Then connect, list the tools, and try
   a read tool such as `list_connections`.
4. Before calling a destructive or open-world tool, review its arguments and
   invoke it deliberately. Configure agent clients to require your approval.

The Inspector UI does not necessarily expand shell variables typed into a form.
Do not enter the literal text `$COGSEND_API_KEY` there and expect expansion; use
the Inspector's local header setting with the key retrieved securely. The CLI
example below uses normal shell variable expansion and never puts a key in the
URL or command source:

```sh
: "${COGSEND_INSTANCE_URL:?Set this to your instance origin}"
: "${COGSEND_API_KEY:?Load this from a secret manager}"
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli \
  "$COGSEND_INSTANCE_URL/api/mcp" \
  --transport http \
  --protocol-era modern \
  --method tools/list \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY"
```

Inspector's CLI calls the Streamable HTTP transport `http`. If the instance is
protected by Cloudflare Access Service Auth, also pass the service-token headers
shown in [Cloudflare Access](access.md); the CogSend key and Access token are
different credentials.

A generic client configuration can be useful in addition to Inspector. This is
a template, not a promise that every client expands shell variables in the same
way. Configure the header through that client's supported environment or secret
store mechanism:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"cogsend": {
			"type": "http",
			"url": "<instance-origin>/api/mcp",
			"headers": {
				"Authorization": "Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## REST API examples

Create a draft, then publish it to one account:

```sh
curl -s -X POST "$APP_URL/api/drafts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Hello","baseBody":"from a script"}'

curl -s -X POST "$APP_URL/api/drafts/DRAFT_ID/publish" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COGSEND_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"connectionIds":["CONN_ID"]}'
```

## Limits

- A body is capped at 100,000 characters, and a variant may carry at most 100
  explicit `threadSegments`.
- Each platform's own text and media limits are checked again at publish, so
  what the API accepts is not necessarily what a platform will take.

## Publishing behaviour

- Publishing the same draft and account twice reuses the row. Already-published accounts come back `skipped: true`.
- A publish that is still running on that account answers **409** with `inFlight` (the connection ids) — wait, then try again.
- A retried segment carries the same platform-side id as its first attempt, so a thread that failed half-way does not double-post what already went out (Mastodon remembers the id for an hour, Bluesky refuses to overwrite the record).
- Sending several connection ids in one request publishes them in order. The first always runs; each further one runs only if it fits in what is left of the request's Cloudflare call budget (50 on Workers Free, see `SUBREQUEST_LIMIT` in [Configuration](configuration.md#secrets)). The ones that don't fit come back with `status: "pending"` and `deferred: true`. They are already due and go out on the next scheduler tick, so don't send those ids again. For the fastest results, send one connection id per request. If the request nevertheless runs out of its per-invocation budget (Workers Free allows 50 database statements), it answers `200` with `stopped: true`, `stoppedError`, and the results it did get. Accounts after the last completed entry were not completed and are still due, so send those ids again. A target interrupted by the failure is left retryable, never `publishing`; a `500` means nothing was recorded, so check the draft before retrying.
- Do not call `/api/targets/:id/retry` unless the row is `failed` (or a stuck `publishing` row older than 15 minutes).
- Schedule returns **409** if that account is already published or still publishing. Check `error`, `alreadyPublished`, and `inFlight` instead of treating HTTP 200 as "it was scheduled".
